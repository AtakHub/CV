  title: "About Me",
  desc: `
I am graduated from TED University as an honorary student, holding a bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. Alongside my expertise in electrical engineering and electronics, I pursued a well-rounded education by taking diverse core courses such as Physics, Elementary German, Introduction to Sociology, World History, and Children's Literature. Additionally, I expanded my academic horizon by completing Business and Administrations as a Secondary Field, aligning with the principles of a liberal education.

Recognizing my affinity for software development, I further honed my skills as a front-end web developer after graduating. Throughout my academic journey, I consistently garnered strong references from my professors, attesting to my dedication and proficiency. In the professional realm, I am committed to delivering my utmost to any organization I am part of, while maintaining a respectful and collaborative approach towards both the work environment and my colleagues.
